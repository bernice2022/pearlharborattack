                  <p>On December 7, 1941, at 7:48 am local time, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched 177 aircraft in a surprise attack on the United States Naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The goal was to cripple the US Pacific Fleet before it could respond to Japanese operations in Southeast Asia on the same day. The attack involved two waves of Japanese aircraft, consisting of bombers, torpedo planes, and fighter planes.</p>

                <div class="feature-text">
                  <p>By mid-1941 the United States had severed all economic relations with Japan and was providing material and financial support to China. Japan had been at war with China since 1937, and the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 ensured that the Soviets were no longer a threat to the Japanese on the Asian mainland. The Japanese believed that once the U.S. The Pacific Fleet was neutralized, all of Southeast Asia would be open for conquest.</p>

                  <p>The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise assault carried out by air and sea forces. The element of surprise was a key factor in the success of the operation.

The first wave targeted airfields and warships, hitting four battleships, including the USS Oklahoma and USS Arizona. The latter exploded, claiming 1,177 lives. A second wave, an hour later, further devastated the harbor. In two hours, 21 US warships were sunk or damaged, 188 aircraft destroyed, and 2,403 Americans killed. Despite the losses, the Pacific Fleet's three aircraft carriers, crucial in later battles, were not at Pearl Harbor during the attack.

            <hr>
            <p>
After the surprise attack, an investigation was launched, leading to the relief of Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and Lieutenant General Walter Short for the failure to adequately prepare for the assault. The aftermath saw an outpouring of anti-Japanese sentiment, resulting in the internment of people of Japanese descent in camps justified as a means against espionage.

</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The attack fueled fear and pride simultaneously. Anti-Japanese sentiment led to the establishment of relocation camps, impacting many Japanese-Americans. On the home front, women stepped into roles in manufacturing as men went off to fight in war.

</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The most significant consequence was the United States' declaration of war against Japan. Contrary to Japan's expectations, the US Navy wasn't crippled as anticipated. Damaged battleships were refloated and repaired, joining the war across the Pacific. Germany and Italy, bound by the Tripartite Pact, declared war on the United States three days later.

            <h3>Global/Japan Impact </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>The attack on Pearl Harbor had historic significance globally, sealing the Allied victory. By drawing the United States into World War II, Japan engaged a formidable foe that ultimately led to their total defeat in 1945.
</p><p>
The most devastating consequence for Japan was the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Resulting in immediate and prolonged casualties, this event marked the beginning of the nuclear age and had a lasting impact on Japan, contributing to its surrender and the end of WW II.

            <p>Captain Genda  was a Japanese naval officer and air strategist who was chosen by Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku to draft the plan for the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor (in Oahu Island, Hawaii, U.S.), which crippled the American Pacific Fleet and precipitated the entry of the United States into World War II.
