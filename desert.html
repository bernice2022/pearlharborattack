                  <p>One primary critique of Yamamoto's decision lies in the <span class="highlight"> incomplete destruction of the Pacific Fleet</span>. Despite causing significant damage to battleships and aircraft, <span class="highlight">Japan failed to neutralize critical assets such as aircraft carriers, which played a role in later Pacific naval battles</span>. Japan underestimated the United States' industrial capacity allowing the U.S. to recover swiftly and rebuild its naval capabilities.  The <span class="highlight"> rapid expansion of the U.S. industrial machine demonstrated its ability to outpace Japan in resource and weapons production</span>, ultimately tipping the balance of power in favor of the Allies.

                  <p>By provoking the United States, <span class="highlight">Japan found itself engaged on two fronts, stretching its military capabilities and exposing vulnerabilities</span>.

                  <p>Moreover, the attack on Pearl Harbor had<span class="highlight"> economic consequences, particularly in terms of resources</span>. Japan's aggression in Asia had already led to an oil embargo by the United States. The decision to attack Pearl Harbor further isolated Japan, exacerbating resource shortages and hindering its capacity to sustain a prolonged war effort.

            <h3>Background Information</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In the early 20th century, Japan underwent rapid industrialization and expansion, seeking to establish itself as a dominant power in Asia. However, Japan faced resource constraints, particularly regarding oil and other raw materials critical for its industrial growth. To address these shortages, Japan sought to expand its territory by annexing neighboring territories rich in resources.</p>
            <p>This expansionist policy led to conflict with the United States, which opposed Japan's aggression in Asia. In response to Japan's invasion of China in 1937 and subsequent atrocities like the Rape of Nanking, the United States imposed economic sanctions on Japan, including an embargo on oil exports. These sanctions severely impacted Japan's ability to sustain its war effort and further strained relations between the two nations.</p>
            <p>Japan's military leaders saw war with the United States as inevitable and began planning a preemptive strike to neutralize American naval power in the Pacific.</p>

            <h3> Actual Attack Incident
</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>On the morning of December 7, 1941, Japanese aircraft launched a devastating aerial assault on the U.S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, located on the island of Oahu in Hawaii. The attack caught the American forces by surprise, destroying or damaging numerous ships, aircraft, and facilities. The most significant losses were suffered by the U.S. Pacific Fleet, with battleships like the USS Arizona and USS Oklahoma sustaining catastrophic damage.
</p>
             <p>The attack resulted in the deaths of over 2,400 Americans and injured over 1,000 more. The destruction of much of the Pacific Fleet left the United States vulnerable in the Pacific and shocked the nation, prompting its entry into World War II. The following day, President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his famous "Day of Infamy" speech to Congress, rallying the nation to declare war on Japan.

            <h3>Summary </h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Pearl Harbor is a U.S. naval base near Honolulu, Hawaii, that was the scene of a devastating surprise attack by Japanese forces on December 7, 1941. Just before 8 a.m. on that Sunday morning, hundreds of Japanese fighter planes descended on the base, where they managed to destroy or damage nearly 20 American naval vessels, including eight battleships, and over 300 airplanes. More than 2,400 Americans died in the attack, including civilians, and another 1,000 people were wounded. The day after the assault, President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked Congress to declare war on Japan.

            <p>Today was supposed to be like any other day in Pearl Harbor, but it turned into something unimaginable. At around 8.00 in the morning I woke up to the sound of explosions, I rushed to my window, only to see Japanese planes flying low. The shock was overwhelming. 4 planes flying about 150 ft in the air came directly over , each plane had a torpedo in the rack underneath.  As they passed, I heard someone yell, "Hey look at the big red ball painted on the tail of the planes."</p>
<p>I could also distinctly hear voices shouting "Tora! Tora! Tora!" Just about then they let go at the Battleships, point blank, about 2 minutes later Icould see the torpedoes exploding in the ships.</p>

            </div>
            <p> The attack continues relentlessly. By this time the guns were opening all around the fleet.  Jap planes were everywhere and I started running and ducking for cover.Buildings smoldered, their flames darkening the sky.  I could see flames shooting up 250 feet in the air and when it blew up, bodies were hurled in the air like bits of paper; some of them landed near or rather pieces of them. Communication lines have been severed, leaving me isolated from the outside world. As the day continues, I can only pray for this nightmare to end.

            <p>The battle seems to be never ending. Fires still burning on the ships that were bombed and torpedoed. I could see the USS Utah and Oklahoma lying over on their sides.Workers and soldiers running around and working tirelessly, using torches to cut through the metal hulls in a desperate attempt to rescue any survivors trapped inside. In the streets, survivors wandered aimlessly, their faces covered with shock and confusion. Some soldiers were issuing dazed clothes out

            <p>Nearby, I saw the navy hospital overflowed with the wounded, while ambulances /trucks, carts, anything that can be used were rushed back and forth to haul men to the hospitals in town. There were hundreds of bodies lying on the grass nearby. It was a heartbreaking sight, one that I'll never forget. These were people who had families, friends, dreams for the future. Now, gone... As I stood there, I said a silent prayer for them and for their loved ones.

            <p>Two destroyers in dry dock burned up and turned over on their sides from bombs. The USS Shaw, in a floating dry dock nearby, has been torn in half by the force of the explosions. As I looked out over the harbor, boats continued to comb the waters, their crews working tirelessly to retrieve the bodies of those lost in the chaos. The air was heavy with the stench of smoke and death.

            <p>The day dragged on, I spotted a procession of women making their way through the yard. They were headed for the hospital, ready to offer their assistance as nurses.The once bustling harbor now lies silent, its waters still stained with the blood. Crews work tirelessly to salvage what remains. The sounds of hammers and saws echo across the harbor as repairs are hastily undertaken.
